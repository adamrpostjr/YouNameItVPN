Needed a Simple place to get some ideas down

--- General Ideas ---
With the dotenv file we could even hold off on loading very important pages until all checks are done on the env file
We could also pack some wireguard server configs into this as well

on user creation we do two things,
1. create and store the key in the database
2. create and store env / config in a directory that the database will point to as well.



--- More Technial Ideas ---
// If env does not exist \\
1. we should create it and start the setup process for the YouNameItVPN
2. We should init a database as well so that we can store key code for anon login
  2a. database will only hold 2 tables
  2b. first table - admin section --- username, password, config location
  2c. second table - login key code(no username/password), directory, last paid, experation date
3. We should during the first run probably ask the user what they want are going to use it for
  3a. Selling VPN
  3b. Site to Site
4. Need to come up with to se



--- Screens ---
- First run
  1. database creation / env creation
  2. Ask if selling or Site to Site
  3. admin user creation
  4. wireguard install / setup
  5. first client setup / start client facing
- Every other time
  1. Login / create screen
  2. Management dashboard
